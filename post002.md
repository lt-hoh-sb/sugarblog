Quick punch-in for today as not much has changed.  We held a quick meeting in which lollipop thug updated us on where he's at with patenting.  Note that we don't have any sort of product, design, or even a sketch of what we wanna do, so patenting is far into the future.

In any case, _here's what we know about patenting_:

- Several levels of patenting exist depending on overall complexity
- Patenting is _expensive_ (~$10k when attorney costs are considered, even at low levels)
- There is a such thing as a __probation patent__
  - Geared towards startups
  - Cheaper, holds __validity for a year__ before needing standard patent
- We don't have money

Believe it or not, all of this is actually good news.  At this stage, any news is good news.  Current skeleton plan is to continue with design until an actual object can be distributed, at which point we can apply for a probation patent.  This will give us a year to come up with the money for a standard patent, should the project be sustained.  Funding ideas are the usual: crowdfunding and accelerators.  lollipop thug wants to implement crowdfunding, but head over heels and I doubt this can be the sole or even primary source of monetary resourcing.  I have a friend who knows plenty of funding opportunities from his own various projects and I used to work in the same office as Accathon Capital, an accelerator based in Soho.

As of now, no actions have been taken in terms of design or funding.  Funding may be able to be punted for a while, at least formal and proper funding.  I think we should really push forward in design, but that's not my responsibilty.  My responsibilty is to nail down full stack web development -- it's time spent now to save on plenty in the future.  The bootcamp I am studying from is actually turning out to be pretty complete (~90 hours in total I believe).  I'll probably start by mastering basic HTML, CSS, and JS before setting up a server and putting up a few small web projects.  I should be able to use git to push local files directly to the server.  After I've made multiple subdomains and ugly but functional sites, I can move on to study intermediate HTML, CSS, and JS.  Thereafter, I'll follow a similar process of creating several subdomains -- hopefully as pretty as they are functional this time around -- before starting to slowly craft our page over time.  As I understand, lollipop thug is asking me to create on online store, and while there would certainly be other purposes of visiting our site, transactions would make up most of our interactions.

In the last update, I mentioned picking up cyber security, and it looks like this may be less of a luxury than I originally thought yesterday.  I'll need to see how everything goes, but it is entirely possible I would end up implementing a third party payment redirection.

My plan moving forward is to take my time in completing this course.  It's gonna make up the brunt of what I do.
