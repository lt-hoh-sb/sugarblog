Another _super_ quick update for today.  Self-study on web development is progressing quickly and well.  I have yet to set up a server or a domain, but right now we aren't in a position to start churning money into something that doesn't exactly need to be accessible online.

That said, I have set us up on GitHub pages.  Currently I am the only one that can push any changes to the repo and -- consequently -- our page, but that shouldn't matter, at least for the time being.

So, overall, we don't really have much more than this GitHub pages blog, but progress is progress and slowly we'll trudge forward.
