Starting this "blog" off basically just as a log for myself.  Here's what I've got so far.  

1. __lollipop thug__ finalized the *idea* and is pushing to figure out *patenting for the product.*
2. __head over heels__ is in charge of *design* and tracking *fashion trends*.
3. __sugarbaby__ covers *coding* and *development.*

lollipop thug's primary request to me has been setting us up online.  For that I'm gonna need to get a lot better at web development, so we're gunning at a Bootcamp on Udemy.  Right now I'm familiar with basic HTML and CSS, but I'm hoping after a few hours of study I'll be able to put up something equally simple but more sophisticated.  No promises or hopes of completion, but gotta start somewhere.

Not directly related, I set up git and github because that's gonna be an absolute necessity in the future.  Haven't initialized a remote or local repo for this project yet, but will likely create one soon just to store all these updates.  __*Note to self: Retouch on this in the future.*__

Since it literally takes one command to initialize a repository I decided to go ahead and punch it in.  

```
[~/_sugartown/dev/web/blog]$ git init                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/_sugartown/dev/web/blog/.git/
[~/_sugartown/dev/web/blog]$ git status                                                                                                                                                                                            *[master] 
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	post001.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
And then I realized I jumped the gun and there's no reason to implement distributed version control on a digital log of events.  So we're gonna keep the repo, but I don't want to commit with every post or export, that'll get clunky.  I'll just keep the note to myself to retouch on this in the future.

Additionally, I'll try to set up a server on a RaspberryPi ASAP.  I'll do some small time reddit research just on tips we would need to start this up.  And although these skills may not directly aid this project, there's no reason not to pick up some cyber security and web app development.

I know I didn't bother talking about the actual idea behind this project, but it's much too early in the process for this to be particularly useful information in tracking my own progress.  lollipop thug has his own journals and whatnot, so I'll leave that part of the logging to him.
